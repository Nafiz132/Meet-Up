Entity Framework (EF) is an **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** for .NET, which makes database operations easier by allowing developers to interact with databases using **C# objects** instead of writing SQL queries directly. Here are its key features explained briefly:

1. **Code First Approach**: You define your data models (classes), and Entity Framework automatically creates the database tables for you based on those models.

2. **Database First Approach**: EF can generate C# classes from an existing database, allowing you to interact with it without manually writing SQL.

3. **Querying with LINQ**: You can query the database using **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query), which is a C# syntax, making it easier to fetch data without SQL.

4. **Change Tracking**: EF automatically tracks changes made to objects during the runtime, so you donâ€™t have to manually manage the state of the data.

5. **Lazy Loading and Eager Loading**: EF can delay loading of related data until it is needed (**Lazy Loading**) or fetch all related data in a single query (**Eager Loading**).

6. **Migration Support**: EF allows you to make incremental changes to your database schema while preserving existing data using migrations.

7. **Automatic Relationships Management**: It handles relationships between tables (e.g., foreign key constraints) through navigation properties in your classes.

Entity Framework simplifies CRUD operations and helps avoid complex SQL code, especially for large projects.
